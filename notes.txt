THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE ADMINISTRATOR WEBPAGE
=============================================================
[OVERVIEW]
->So in the process of creating the Admin page, it requires me
to understand the different Use Cases that we're stated for the 
admin role, so the main uses that this Admin Page needs to 
provide are:
    ->Validating the Election System Admins
    ->Registering Candidates
    ->Validating Candidates
    ->Validating Users
    ->Adding Political Party mainfestoes
    ->Updating the Voting statistics for analytics
    ->Publishing the Votes
    ->Tracking the Votes
    ->Tracking the Countdown to elections

->So my first step is selecting the format, which is inspired
by the CPUT sos portal, as it has a layout that is very laid 
out for adminstative purposes(it allows for the user to select)
the task they want to perform on the Website through their 
side task bar, and that will be the same type of layout that I'll
be using

->A sample website will be based on the W3Schools tutorial on a 
admin dashboard using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and here's the 
breakdown of how its going to look and function:
    ->this program takes into account the layout(i.e. navigation,
sidebar) and responsiveness of the dashboard.
    ->in the admin panel, we have multiple sections for controlling
the admin activities, and we have the following elements:
    -->header
    -->navbar
    -->search bar
